		<p>
		<cmd>Double click existing points</cmd> to remove them from the curve.  <cmd>Double click empty areas</cmd> to append a new control point to the end of the curve.
		</p>

		<p>
			You may change the knot vector, as well as the order of the curve, with the associated slider elements located on the canvas.  The first and last knot vectors are not shown, and fixed to the values 0 and 1 on each side of the lower slider.
		</p>

		<canvas id="canvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

		<p>
			Because of the way B-splines are defined, unless the knot vector is modified to be non-uniform, not all of the curve is defined.  Specifically, the curve is only defined for t from the k'th knot vector, to the m-k'th knot vector.
		</p>

		<p>
			That is, to define the curve up to the first and last point, 2 knot vectors to 0 and 1 each, for a curve of degree 2.
		</p>

		<p>
			Due to the recursive implementation, selecting curve order above 10 is not recommended.
