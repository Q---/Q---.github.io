		<h2>Point Projection onto Arbitrary Curves/Surfaces</h2>

		<p>
		In the general case, point projection onto a surface is a non-trivial task.  Here, I demonstrate a reasonably efficient heuristic for finding the projection of a point onto a surface.  The method is also simple, but it obtains these two aspects (efficiency and simplicity) by trading away 100% accuracy.
		</p>

		<p>
		First, one generates N "initial guess points" on the curve or surface (Uniformly distributed in the curve parameter t).  Then, we choose the closest initial guess point, then perform gradient descent to refine our parameter, for M iterations.  Here "N" is 6, and "M" is 10.
		</p>

		<p>
		The expected utility in using this method appears when we expect any given change in the point or surface to be small.  We can then skip the "initial guess points" step, and use our previous projection as the initial condition for our new projection.
		</p>

		<p>
		<cmd>Double click existing points</cmd> to remove them from the curve.  <cmd>Double click empty areas</cmd> to append a new control point to the end of the curve.  <cmd>Hold shift and double click</cmd> to add or remove projection points.
		</p>

		<h3>Possible improvements</h3>
		<p>
		This method fails to find the closest projection in a few 'degenerate' cases, such as self-intersecting curves, or highly elongated curves.  A possible improvement in robustness could be obtained by instead doing a gradient-descent refinement on <b>all</b> of the initial estimate projections.  As well, one could place the initial estimate projections uniformly in terms of arc-length, not the surface parameter.  (Since the surface parameter space can be "squished" an arbitrary amount without changing the shape of the curve");
