		<h2>Accurate (Nonlinear) Pendulum.</h2>
		
		<p>This pendulum is a an accurate, not-physically-interactive single pendulum.  By accurate, it's motion does not assume the small-angle approximation, which is necessary for analytic solutions of movement.

		It's actual equation of motion is a second-order nonlinear differential equation for which there are no closed form solutions.  Here, we numerically integrate the equations of motion using RK4, the fourth-order Runge Kutta method, written in Javascript.</p>
