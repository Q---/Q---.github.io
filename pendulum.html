		<h2>Accurate (Nonlinear) Pendulum.</h2>

		<p>
		This pendulum is a an accurate, not-physically-interactive single pendulum.  By 'accurate', I mean it's motion does not assume the small-angle approximation, which is necessary for analytic solutions of movement.  Even so, this simulation assumes the rod is rigid and massless.
		</p>

		<p>
		The actual equation of motion is a second-order nonlinear differential equation for which there are no closed form solutions.  Here, we numerically integrate the equations of motion using RK4, the fourth-order Runge Kutta method, written in Javascript.
		</p>

		<p>
		The rigidity of the rod appears naturally from our choice of coordinates:  The system is generalized in terms of angle, so it is impossible for the rod to extend or contract due to numerical drift or inaccuracy.  This is an fundamental example of how clever choice of coordinates can naturally resolve constraints without any extra computation.
