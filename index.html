		<h2>Welcome to my Modeling and Simulation lab.</h2>
		<p>
		This is a cetralized repository of the various physics and math projects I work on.  Lately, my goal has been to build accurate physical simulations of pendulums, with the end goal of a physically accurate rope. (i.e. one with no energy loss).
		</p>

		<p>
		Most, if not all, literature you can find on the subject (And by literature, I mean game development discussions on the web) use inaccurate, if computationally inexpensive tricks.  Furthermore, the state of the rope is usually in Cartesian, rather than generalized, coordinates.
