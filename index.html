		<h2>Welcome to my Modeling and Simulation lab.</h2>
		<p>
		This is a centralized repository of the various physics and math projects I work on.  Two months ago, I was researching various continuous physical simulation methods, for use in progressively more complex pendulum simulations.  Currently, I'm working on evaluation and graphing of parametric curves in 2d space for a course I'm taking.
		</p>

		<p>
		I hope to be able to both evaluate the basis spline curve for an arbitrary amount of knots, reparameterize the curve in terms of arc-length, and find either a closed form solution or numerical method for evaluating the tangent line at each point in the curve.  This will allow me to distribute various point geometry, or even images, along the curve with correct orientation.
		</p>

		<p>
		In the 3D case, this would allow one to graphically draw a tube instead of just a curve, by placing a circle at each point in the curve.  You would then arrive at a 3D polygon figure.  Drawing 3D polygons is not obvious in web browsers, but there does exist not-oft-used web browser functionalities that allow you to draw 3D environments.
