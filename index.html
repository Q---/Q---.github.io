		<h2>Welcome to my Modeling and Simulation lab.</h2>
		<p>This is a cetralized repository of the various physics and math projects I work on.  Lately, my goal has been to build accurate physical simulations of pendulums, with the end goal of a physically accurate - one that does not lose energy - rope.</p>
