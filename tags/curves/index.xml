      <description>Quadratic Bézier curves are explicit parametric functions of the following form:
These curves are perhaps the simplest class of parametric curves, but useful in their own right. This is a small demo of such curves.
Drag the control points around to see the curve change.
Background The general form of an nth order Bézier curve, with n+1 control points, can be represented explicitly with the following summation:
The tick marks in the demo correspond to the segment lines of intersection (related to the tangent line) at each point.</description>
