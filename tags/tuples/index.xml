      <title>Unchained Tuple Types</title>

      <description>The asserts syntax introduced with TS 3.7 allows us to interleave mutative runtime code with type annotations to express type mutations in a powerful way.
This allows us to do away with the chaining syntax as described in my earlier article, Chained Tuple Types, and express our Set mutations in a much more familiar iterative way:
const set: Set = new Set();  set.insert(2); set.insert(4); set.insert(8); set.remove(4);  const hasResult1 = set.</description>

      <title>String Deduplication on the Type Level</title>

      <description>The string deduplication problem is a canonical one within computer science, serving a similar purpose as fizz-buzz in terms of being an example of a simple problem that a reasonably knowledgable practitioner should be able to solve with minimal effort.
The problem appears in a few variants, but briefly one such variant is to remove duplicate letters in a given string, such that the string then has only one instance of any given letter.</description>

      <title>Chained Tuple Types</title>

      <description>With Typescript 4.1, it&amp;rsquo;s now possible to use variadic tuple types to construct large types with what appears to be runtime code. The general idea is that we will utilize a chaining pattern, where each operation on the chain returns an expanded version of the chain&amp;rsquo;s type.
To motivate the example, let us consider a Set class. Our Set is a chaining class, where you may insert, remove, and check for the existence of numbers.</description>
