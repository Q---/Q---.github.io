      <description>The asserts syntax introduced with TS 3.7 allows us to interleave mutative runtime code with type annotations to express type mutations in a powerful way.
This allows us to do away with the chaining syntax as described in my earlier article, Chained Tuple Types, and express our Set mutations in a much more familiar iterative way:
const set: Set = new Set(); set.insert(2); set.insert(4); set.insert(8); set.remove(4); const hasResult1 = set.has(8); // :: true const hasResult2 = set.</description>

      <description>With Typescript 4.1, it&amp;rsquo;s now possible to use variadic tuple types to construct large types with what appears to be runtime code. The general idea is that we will utilize a chaining pattern, where each operation on the chain returns an expanded version of the chain&amp;rsquo;s type.
To motivate the example, let us consider a Set class. Our Set is a chaining class, where you may insert, remove, and check for the existence of numbers.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Function Map Constraints</title>

      <description>Some &amp;ldquo;easy to state&amp;rdquo; problems in Typescript can require somewhat sophisticated type constructs.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to enforce that every function in a particular map takes in as its first parameter, either a number or a string:
type PermissibleInput = number | string; const myFunctionMap = { foobar(x: number): void; barfoo(y: string): void; } If you do this in the naive way, as e.g. Record&amp;lt;string, (number | string) =&amp;gt; any&amp;gt;, you will discover that this type actually encodes the requirements that every function must support both input types - which is a problem, as myFunctionMap is not actually composed of such functions.</description>

      <title>Self Modifying Type Predicates in Typescript</title>

      <description>Typescript&amp;rsquo;s type system is uniquely powerful among mainstream programming languages, approximating the expressive power of Haskell or Idris, while also remaining flexible enough for production applications.
Type predicates are a useful tool in building a well-typed software framework. Essentially, they allow you to &amp;ldquo;simulate&amp;rdquo; dependent types, a powerful type feature present in Idris.
Further explanation on type predicates can be found here.
The premise of this article is a usage of type predicates I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen discussed online - most type predicates just modify one of their arguments, but you can actually form a predicate on this because it is an implicit argument.</description>
