		<h2>Characteristic Shape Algorithm</h2>

		<p>
		The "Characteristic Shape" algorithm generates a simple polygon given a planar set of points, that encompasses said points.  It is a generalization of the convex hull, and can be said to generate "concave" hulls.
		</p>

		<p>
		The algorithm initially calculates the Delaunay triangulation of the set of points.  Then, it iteratively removes the longest "boundary edges", or edges on the outside of the triangulation.  It does this in O(n lg(n)) time,
		and O(n) space.  It uses relational maps to keep track of the edges, constitutent triangles, and boundary efficiently.  However, this particular implementation of the algorithm is technically O(n^2) in time, due to the fact that
		this implementation uses simple arrays, rather than, for example, B-Trees.
		</p>
