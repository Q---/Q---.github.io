		The "roll" of the 'camera' is clamped.  The reality of how that is done is more complicated, and has nothing to do with roll, hence the quotes.  In fact, the original 3D coordinates of the points are not saved; rotation and scaling transformations are simply performed on the only copy of the set of points.
