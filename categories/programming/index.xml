      <description>In a previous article, Higher Kinded Types in Typescript, we explored how to encode HKTs, as well as some of their applications.
For example, we could define a value and type-level operation like the following:
// &amp;#34;hello! hello!&amp;#34; const result = map(double, map(append(&amp;#34;! &amp;#34;), &amp;#34;hello&amp;#34;)); On both the type and value levels, the given string goes through a complex operation. In the end though, the type system can still capture and encode the operations being performed.</description>

      <description>HKTs are a powerful abstraction. Just as there are different types of higher-order functions, so are there so-called &amp;lsquo;higher-kinded types&amp;rsquo;.
Taxonomy This blog post concerns one particular type of HKT - to define the taxonomy, first we will cover a few types, and a way they can be categorized.
We can classify types in terms of &amp;lsquo;order&amp;rsquo;, a rough level of abstraction.
Here are a zero-order types that exist:
 number string 42 (x: number) =&amp;gt; number (f: (.</description>

      <description>There are a few interesting questions about the nature of programs, and specifically about sets of programs, as represented by lambda calculus expressions.
 1. How many programs have N terms? 2. How fast does the set of programs of length N grow? 3. How many programs of length N converge? 4. What is the longest-running convergent program of length N? 5. How fast does BB(N) grow? 6. What percentage of programs converge?</description>
