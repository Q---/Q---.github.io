      <title>String Deduplication on the Type Level</title>

      <description>The string deduplication problem is a canonical one within computer science, serving a similar purpose as fizz-buzz in terms of being an example of a simple problem that a reasonably knowledgable practitioner should be able to solve with minimal effort.&#xA;The problem appears in a few variants, but briefly one such variant is to remove duplicate letters in a given string, such that the string then has only one instance of any given letter.</description>

      <title>Dijkstra&#39;s Shunting Yard in Typescript</title>

      <description>The shunting yard algorithm converts infix expressions (i.e. 1+2) into reverse Polish notation, i.e. 1 2 +, which lends itself well to execution on a stack machine.&#xA;An aside: I wanted to revisit this algorithm because it was one of the first I implemented in C during self-study five years ago. In a way, reimplementing it is a way of measuring my progress since then.&#xA;The internal details aren&amp;rsquo;t too complicated - it&amp;rsquo;s based on the simple pseudo-code of the Wikipedia article describing the shunting yard algorithm.</description>

      <title>Pythagorean Triple Problem in Sub-linear Time</title>
      <link>https://code.lol/post/algorithms/pythagorean-triple/</link>

      <description>The Pythagorean triple problem is as follows. Given an input integer \(n\), return integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) such that the two following conditions hold:&#xA;$$ a b c = n $$ $$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $$&#xA;I was interested in finding a solution to this problem that was both succint and had good asymptotic complexity. The solution I found runs in O(sqrt(n)) time by deconstructing the problem into the well-known 3SUM problem.</description>
